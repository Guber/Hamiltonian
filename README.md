# Hamiltonian
 
Search for a hamiltonian cycle, than if there is no hamiltonian cycle, we can search for an almost hamiltonian path using dynamic programming and tabulation techniques.

This has been done for a college class in graph theory. And together with my code I supply a few of test cases which we were given in the class.

To run it you need to pass to it as an argument the name of a file which contains an adjacency matrix.

For instance test1.txt could be:

4<br />
0111<br />
1011<br />
1101<br />
1101
